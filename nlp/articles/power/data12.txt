"India is considering operating about 40 gigawatts of stressed coal-fired plants through state-run power companies, power minister R.K. Singh said Monday.The proposal to run the projects through a special-purpose vehicle formed by state-run NTPC Ltd., Power Finance Corp. and Rural Electrification Corp. aims to make them economically viable for eventual sale. Identified stressed plants may get power-purchase agreements for nearly 40-50 percent capacity and the rest may need to be sold on the spot market, Singh said in New Delhi.A recent revision of loan repayment norms for stressed power assets may push 75 gigawatts of projects that are facing financial problems toward bankruptcy, according to a letter written by industry lobby group Association of Power Producers to Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel earlier this month.â€” With assistance by Rajesh Kumar Singh"
